# My To-Do List

This is a simple To-Do List application built with **React** and **TypeScript**. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It's designed to help you manage your daily tasks effectively.

## Project Purpose

This project was created as a study exercise to improve my skills in **React** and **TypeScript**. The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience with these technologies while building a functional application. Although this app is fully functional, it serves as a learning tool rather than a production-level application.

## Features

- **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Delete Task:** Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Edit Task:** Users can edit task's title.
- **Mark as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leduardovb/my-todo-list.git
cd my-todo-list
yarn install
```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the application locally using:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the app by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **CSS:** Styling the application.
